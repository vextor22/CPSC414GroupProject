# Project Synopsis

The goal of this project is to provide a user with an entertainment solution that offers new and refined ways to relax and use entertainment easily and intuitively in their homes. Home entertainment is a large market, and nearly every person has some preference for how he/she wants to use entertainment in his/her home. People also have various complaints about existing systems and ways that these systems can be refined and adjusted to suit their needs. Our goal is to meet some of these needs and expectations in new and creative ways by identifying a problem within home entertainment and offering a solution to this problem.
